### Criterion 2

I initially had played to introduce this feature in order to give the player more of a sense of completion but have found as I moved through that this was too much with the time I had. Programming features like this was beyond my capability and with the time frame was not something I was able to learn and develop new skills for.\
\
As I move through and have got the main functionalities of the game, I can now go back and complete these features to flesh out the game and give the player more to play and achieve.

### Criterion 3

The video footage in [Cycle 1](../2-design-and-development/cycle-1.md) it demonstrates how collisions are used in the game and are used in later cycles where the map is more filled to show how certain areas are blocked off using this same collision system established early on.

### Criterion 4

I had planned this feature to give the player more room to explore through underground areas in the map that the player can vertically travel. Whilst developing&#x20;
