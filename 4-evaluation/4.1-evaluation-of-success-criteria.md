# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Level layout and design

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                              | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1         | Wide open map for the player to explore however they choose                              | Cycle 1              |
| 2         | Areas unlocked through short puzzles                                                     | Wasn't achieved      |
| 3         | Areas blocked of or forbidden in the progression of the game through collision detection | Cycle 1              |
| 4         | Multiple layers to the map not just surface level                                        | Wasn't achieved      |
| 5         | Inside areas / separate maps to represent inside of buildings                            | Cycle 10             |
| 6         | Areas inhabited by lots of enemies and others with none                                  | Cycle 4              |

This shows how the map is wide and open for the player to explore wherever they would like whether that is outside or inside the houses and explore indoors

### Criterion 2

I initially had played to introduce this feature in order to give the player more of a sense of completion but have found as I moved through that this was too much with the time I had. Programming features like this was beyond my capability and with the time frame was not something I was able to learn and develop new skills for.\
\
As I move through and have got the main functionalities of the game, I can now go back and complete these features to flesh out the game and give the player more to play and achieve.

### Criterion 3

The video footage in [Cycle 1](../2-design-and-development/cycle-1.md) it demonstrates how collisions are used in the game and are used in later cycles where the map is more filled to show how certain areas are blocked off using this same collision system established early on.

### Criterion 4

I had planned this feature to give the player more room to explore through underground areas in the map that the player can vertically travel. Whilst developing my project however with the time frame given I decided the size of the map with inside areas was enough for the player to be able to explore and enjoy. Later on in development this will be a feature that I will work on with enough given time, I aim to continuously expand the map and give the player more areas to explore.&#x20;

### Criterion 5

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

With the image above and video evidence from [Cycle 10](../design-and-development/cycle-1-9.md), you can see the separate areas and indoors of buildings that players can explore with their own game scene to use. Whilst I did not justify this having its whole individual cycle since most of the work involved designing and less programming I believe this is still a key feature that I achieved to gain a truly interactive experience.

### Criterion 6

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

The image above and video evidence from [cycle 4](../design-and-development/cycle-1-3.md) onwards demonstrate certain areas that inhabit more enemies compared to other areas such as the inside of buildings that contain no enemies or anything combat related.
