# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Level layout and design

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                              | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1         | Wide open map for the player to explore however they choose                              | Cycle 1              |
| 2         | Areas unlocked through short puzzles                                                     | Wasn't achieved      |
| 3         | Areas blocked of or forbidden in the progression of the game through collision detection | Cycle 2              |
| 4         | Multiple layers to the map not just surface level                                        | Wasn't achieved      |
| 5         | Inside areas / separate maps to represent inside of buildings                            | Cycle 10             |
| 6         | Areas inhabited by lots of enemies and others with none                                  | Cycle 4              |

This shows how the map is wide and open for the player to explore wherever they would like whether that is outside or inside the houses and explore indoors

### Criterion 2

I initially had played to introduce this feature in order to give the player more of a sense of completion but have found as I moved through that this was too much with the time I had. Programming features like this was beyond my capability and with the time frame was not something I was able to learn and develop new skills for.\
\
As I move through and have got the main functionalities of the game, I can now go back and complete these features to flesh out the game and give the player more to play and achieve.

### Criterion 3

The video footage in [Cycle 1](../2-design-and-development/cycle-1.md) it demonstrates how collisions are used in the game and are used in later cycles where the map is more filled to show how certain areas are blocked off using this same collision system established early on.

### Criterion 4

I had planned this feature to give the player more room to explore through underground areas in the map that the player can vertically travel. Whilst developing my project however with the time frame given I decided the size of the map with inside areas was enough for the player to be able to explore and enjoy. Later on in development this will be a feature that I will work on with enough given time, I aim to continuously expand the map and give the player more areas to explore.&#x20;

### Criterion 5

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

With the image above and video evidence from [Cycle 10](../design-and-development/cycle-1-9.md), you can see the separate areas and indoors of buildings that players can explore with their own game scene to use. Whilst I did not justify this having its whole individual cycle since most of the work involved designing and less programming I believe this is still a key feature that I achieved to gain a truly interactive experience.

### Criterion 6

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

The image above and video evidence from [cycle 4](../design-and-development/cycle-1-3.md) onwards demonstrate certain areas that inhabit more enemies compared to other areas such as the inside of buildings that contain no enemies or anything combat related.

## UI

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                          | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| 7         | Player should be presented with a nice and easy title screen upon launch to navigate | Cycle 10             |
| 8         | Options for customisation settings such as auto save features etc to toggle          | Wasn't achieved      |
| 9         | A menu presented upon pausing the game with options to save or leave the game        | Wasn't achieved      |
| 10        | The player should easily be able to start a new game                                 | Cycle 10             |

### Criterion 7

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

&#x20;The screenshot above demonstrates me achieving the criterion by creating a simple and visually appealing title screen with only a few options for the player so they do not get lost or confused when navigating the menu

### Criterion 8

I had aimed for this to be development to give the player some options for customisation to make the game easier to run on a larger range of devices and increase the ways it can be played. However I was not able to achieve this with the time I had and is one of my main features I aim to develop next since I already have the menu ready and all that is to do is the main functionality of changing properties such as screen size and more. \
\
One thing I noticed is that this may not even be necessary since with the way the game performs with double the frame rate needed for a smooth experience according to my [success criteria](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md) I doubt any modern devices will struggle trying to run this game even without customisation choices.

### Criterion 9

This is another feature I aim to integrate soon since I believe this is in my capabilities and is not too challenging with a similar menu needed so I can reuse a majority of the code. I believe this will be an important part of the game allowing people to take a break if need be and will hopefully be supported in the near future of my development.

### Criterion 10

Evidence for criterion 10 can be seen in [Cycle 10](../design-and-development/cycle-1-9.md) when the player interacts the "Play" button to start a new game and is presented upon launch of the game with the main menu mentioned in [Criterion 7](4.1-evaluation-of-success-criteria.md#criterion-7)
