# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                       | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | There is a sufficient amount of gameplay to enjoy | Partial success |

Whilst I did not expand the game and amount of content as much as I had intended with the initial goals of the game, however the results from question 1 in [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md) the results were either neutral or positive. Despite the mixture of results no player said they did not enjoy the amount of gameplay but some had implied there could have been more ideally for more to do and play through. Therefore in my future development I aim to expand the amount of content whether that is areas to explore or new quests to complete.

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Different areas of the game are easy to find and access | Success      |

### Feature 1

I believe that this criteria was a big success with everyone who tested, as seen in question 4 in [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md), agreed with the prompt that areas of the game and map were easy to find and access. This can always be improved on however with small indicators to make it easy as possible for the player but at the moment is not something I am choosing to focus on for near future development.
