# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* Amount of content to play through - Can finish the game fairly quickly
* Limitations to only one platform - Can only be played on PC inside a browser
* Graphics and art - Whilst some of the assets were custom made others were free for non profit so the game being monetised without a change in assets is unfeasible.
* Performance - Performance is limited to the capabilities of the computer and browser
* No variation / replayability - Same tasks and missions every play through
* No music or sound - Takes away immersion&#x20;
