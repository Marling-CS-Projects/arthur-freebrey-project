# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* **Content** - Can finish the game fairly quickly due to a small amount of content
* **Limitations to only one platform** - Can only be played on PC inside a browser
* **Graphics and art** - Whilst some of the assets were custom made others were free for non profit so the game being monetised without a change in assets is unfeasible.
* **Performance** - Performance is limited to the capabilities of the computer and browser
* **No variation** **/ Replayability** - Same tasks and missions every play through
* **No music or sound** - Takes away immersion&#x20;

## Maintenance

The game would require a variety of maintenance strategies depending on the whether the aims are to work on performance and expand the gameplay or work on game art and sound design

### Current size

If the game was to remain its current size by the number of features and content then I would only need to undergo and consider the short term development plan mentioned later on. This means I would have adequate time to fix any serious bugs and issues impeding gameplay but would not address any of the things pointed out in the [**#Current Limitations of Project**](4.3-maintenance-and-future-development.md#current-limitations-of-project)**.** The game does not necessarily need to address these ideas pointed out earlier since the game can still be played and enjoyed without these changed.\
\
After this stage of development of fixing crucial gameplay affecting bugs there would then need to be another phase of testing to make sure the game would be appropriate for a full release. After a full release is published, the only maintenance needed is to make sure the game is still running on Github Pages which integrates easily with Github, which is where my code is already hosted.

## Future Development

### Short Term Plan

#### Bug Fixes

Before further development were to take place adding new features I would need to fix some current bugs / problems addressing the game in its current state first. If the game is to present as polished and finished then all types of bugs whether they effect the gameplay or not should be tackled. A list of a issues/bugs that I have come across independently or through [**Usability Testing**](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md) **** are below.

* _You can trick the main quest by leaving and re-entering the starting area:_ How this would be tackled is changing the way the quest objective is measured. By changing to a sceneEmit that tracks across all Phaser scenes then the need for separate measures in different areas of the map is unneeded and can work with missions later on.
* _Certain parts of the map have invisible colliders_: This is a texturing issue that can be changed by changing the graphics and art of the game and making sure there is no empty space on the assets that would be handled by the collision engine.
* _Player has to be positioned very precisely to interact with NPC_:  This can be fixed by changing the parameters needed to interact with the NPC. It is currently measured by the player having to press the interact key and be stood in a certain pixel precise area facing the NPC. This could instead by changed to a radius measurement of how far away they are to the NPC removing the precise positioning needed that can become inconvenient when playing.

#### Changing Enemy Behaviour

Implementing enemies with changed properties such as spawn rate and movement speed can make the game more engaging and interesting to play. This would mean more skill is required for some parts of the game to complete but would also not be complicated to implement since it mostly involves changing existing parameters I had set up earlier in the code to be easily adapted.

### Long Term Plan

#### Current Limitations&#x20;

The current limitations outlined earlier will be essential for allowing the game to grow so they will be the key focus of a long term plan of development.  The current limitations of the project are listed below.

* **Content** - Can finish the game fairly quickly due to a small amount of content
* **Limitations to only one platform** - Can only be played on PC inside a browser
* **Graphics and art** - Whilst some of the assets were custom made others were free for non profit so the game being monetised without a change in assets is unfeasible.
* **Performance** - Performance is limited to the capabilities of the computer and browser
* **No variation** **/ Replayability** - Same tasks and missions every play through
* **No music or sound** - Takes away immersion

#### Content / Length of gameplay

As there is only one main quest to complete and a select few areas to explore and enemies to fight, the gameplay amount remains quite short. In order to attract new players and keep current ones engaged more gameplay would need to be added and can be done many ways. Whether this is through more challenges with each building containing their own NPC and task to complete or more enemies scattered throughout. Other changes could be more areas to explore or changing the types of enemies faced would each increase retention and time spent by the player hence inducing a more positive experience.
