# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* **Content** - Can finish the game fairly quickly due to a small amount of content
* **Limitations to only one platform** - Can only be played on PC inside a browser
* **Graphics and art** - Whilst some of the assets were custom made others were free for non profit so the game being monetised without a change in assets is unfeasible.
* **Performance** - Performance is limited to the capabilities of the computer and browser
* **No variation** **/ Replayability** - Same tasks and missions every play through
* **No music or sound** - Takes away immersion&#x20;

## Maintenance

The game would require a variety of maintenance strategies depending on the whether the aims are to work on performance and expand the gameplay or work on game art and sound design

### Current size

If the game was to remain its current size by the number of features and content then I would only need to undergo and consider the short term development plan mentioned later on. This means I would have adequate time to fix any serious bugs and issues impeding gameplay but would not address any of the things pointed out in the [**#Current Limitations of Project**](4.3-maintenance-and-future-development.md#current-limitations-of-project)****

## Future Development

### Short Term Bug Fixes

describe aspects that might need tweaking

### Long Term Addressing Limitations

describe aspects that could be developed to address the limitations identified earlier
