# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* **Content** - Can finish the game fairly quickly due to a small amount of content
* **Limitations to only one platform** - Can only be played on PC inside a browser
* **Graphics and art** - Whilst some of the assets were custom made others were free for non profit so the game being monetised without a change in assets is unfeasible.
* **Performance** - Performance is limited to the capabilities of the computer and browser
* **No variation** / replayability - Same tasks and missions every play through
* **No music or sound** - Takes away immersion&#x20;
