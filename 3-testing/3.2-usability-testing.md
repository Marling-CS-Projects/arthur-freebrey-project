# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

In order to access the overall experience of my project and how it matches up against my criteria I will collect feedback from a small group of users who had played my game.

| Test                   | Test Details                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Easy to Learn      | Are the controls easy to understand? Is the menu easy to navigate?                      |
| 2 - Error tolerant     | Did you encounter any bugs whilst playing? Is you answered yes please detail bugs found |
| 3 - Engaging / Visuals | I found the visual style appealing                                                      |
| 4 - Efficient          | Are different areas in the map easy to find / access?                                   |
| 5 - Effective          | There is a sufficient amount of gameplay to enjoy                                       |
