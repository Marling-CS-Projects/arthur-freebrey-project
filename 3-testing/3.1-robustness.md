# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

For my success criteria I compared these tests for robustness against existing criteria I had in my [1.5-success-criteria.md](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md "mention") and see how them compare after my development.

| Criterion | Description                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 17        | The game must not crash whilst playing through |
| 18        | Game must run on at least 30fps                |

### Criterion 17

In order to try and measure criteria 17 I must intentional perform out of the ordinary behaviour in order to try get the the game to crash such as:

* Swapping between maps quickly
* Hitting existing lizard coordinates multiple times
* Speaking to the NPC characters multiple times quickly

After testing these points the game did not crash after performing these actions however I did encounter some visual glitches on the test regarding consistently speaking to the NPC multiple times.
