# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

For my success criteria I compared these tests for robustness against existing criteria I had in my [1.5-success-criteria.md](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md "mention") and see how them compare after my development.

| Criterion | Description                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 17        | The game must not crash whilst playing through |
| 18        | Game must run on at least 30fps                |

### Criterion 17

In order to try and measure criteria 17 I must intentional perform out of the ordinary behaviour in order to try get the the game to crash such as:

* Swapping between maps quickly
* Hitting existing lizard coordinates multiple times
* Speaking to the NPC characters multiple times quickly

After testing these points the game did not crash after performing these actions however I did encounter some visual glitches on the test regarding consistently speaking to the NPC multiple times.\
\
This leads me to believe the game is relatively stable and only displays visual bugs upon abnormal behaviour I have not yet fixed but nothing that would break the game and ruin the criterion.

### Criterion 18

In order to measure the criterion number 18 I must display a frame counter to measure whether the game is meeting the requirement of a minimum of 30. To make sure I was testing this accurately I tried to put as much strain as possible on the game by performing abnormal behaviour such as rapid collision or changing of scenes.\

Here you can see in the screenshot provided the game even after intensive usage the game always consistently on all devices I tested ran at a range of 55-60 and never dropped below the 55 mark. This shows how my game can match the criterion specified of a minimum of 30fps to make sure the gameplay stays engaging.&#x20;
