## Systems Diagram

I have created a Systems Diagram to outline the various components of the game I am developing. The diagram is based on my goals and success criteria for the project, and is divided into smaller sub-sections. To streamline the development process, I plan to work on one or two sections at a time, gradually assembling the game using computational methods.

## Usability Features

My game's usability is a top priority as I want it to be accessible to all players. To create the best user experience, I will focus on five key points: effectiveness, efficiency, engagement, error tolerance and making the game easy to learn.

### Effective

Users can achieve the goal with completeness and accuracy. To do this, I will make the map simplified and not complicated to navigate. This also ties into my point I mentioned earlier about making the game fair but challenging - this will create an effective gameplay for the user.

#### Aims

* Create a fair gameplay environment for the user
* Keep the map exploration fun but not too hard to navigate

### Efficiency

Efficiency relates to the speed and accuracy to which a user can complete the goal. To do this, I will aim to create a menu system which is easy to navigate through in order for to find what you are looking for making sure the process of starting the game remains simple.

#### Aims

* Create an automatic system to load the game where it was set off to avoid any complication of loading saves
* Create a controls system that isn't too complicated but allows the player to perform multiple actions while playing

### Engaging

The solution is engaging for the user to use. To do this, I will create a visually appealing art style involving pixel art to make sure they aren't pushed away by the graphics and giving a large amount of content to explore to make sure they remain engaged.

#### Aims

* Create a large map and area to explore for the players
* Incorporate a style of game art the suits the game

### Error Tolerant

To minimize errors and ensure a smooth gameplay experience, I will write code that can handle various scenarios and can self-correct if any errors occur. This will prevent the game from crashing during playtime.

#### Aims

* The game should not crash
* The game does not contain any bugs that damage the users experience playing

### Easy To Learn

To make the game user-friendly, I will design simple controls that are easy to understand and use. I will avoid adding unnecessary controls, keeping the game as straightforward as possible for players.

#### Aims

* The game should not take long to understand and get the hang of
* The game should not be too difficult for an individual to not complete and enjoy
