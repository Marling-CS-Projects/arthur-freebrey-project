# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design

### Objectives

In this development cycle my aim is to create a HTML project with Typescript using parcel for building the page. Using the Phaser.js library I went on to create scenes and backgrounds from custom maps I have designed which I could then build on top of later on.\
\
However a lot of the code in this cycle may need to be rewritten later on and refactored but I believe that this is important into learning more about the libraries and me getting familiar in how to code effectively with them.

* [x] Set up an environment in VS Code with TypeScript support
* [x] Create the GitHub repository to store the code in.
* [x] Get the website to build and run on localhost
* [x] Create working scenes with Phaser.js
* [x] Import and use custom sprites and maps through JSON files

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| create        | Initialises all the variables at the start of the game such as sprites.                     |
| update        | Updates the position of the character and other information every frame                     |
| mainMap       | Variable that stores the JSON information for the map and where each tile goes              |
| velocity(X,Y) | The speed assigned to the player when key inputs are pressed determining how fast they move |
| player        | Variable that stores all of the information and properties about the character.             |
