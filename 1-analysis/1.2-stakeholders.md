## PEGI Ratings

PEGI (Pan European Game Information) is a system made to help people make decisions on purchasing games by informing them of a recommended age rating for the game and its appropriateness. The system rates games according to recommended minimum age in order to play. Games can be given the recommended age rating of 3, 7, 12, 16 or 18.

[(Pegi.info, 2020)](../evaluation/reference-list.md) The ratings are decided by PEGI independently upon the publisher's view of the game and 7 different categories can affect the rating:

* Bad language
* Discrimination
* Drugs
* Fear
* Gambling
* Sex
* Violence\
