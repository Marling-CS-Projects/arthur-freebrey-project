## PEGI Ratings

PEGI (Pan European Game Information) is a system made to help people make decisions on purchasing games by informing them of a recommended age rating for the game and its appropriateness. The system rates games according to recommended minimum age in order to play. Games can be given the recommended age rating of 3, 7, 12, 16 or 18.

[(Pegi.info, 2020)](../evaluation/reference-list.md) The ratings are decided by PEGI independently upon the publisher's view of the game and 7 different categories can affect the rating:

* Bad language
* Discrimination
* Drugs
* Fear
* Gambling
* Sex
* Violence\

## How this applies

With PEGI ratings in mind I would like my game to have the widest reach possible without having to sacrifice features that I had originally planned to implement. Taking this into consideration and comparing this to existing products on the market with similar ideas I would like to aim to have the game be at a PEGI rating of 7. PEGI describes a rating of 7 as: \
\
"features non-realistic violence in a child-friendly setting or context, violence that lacks any apparent harm or injury to fantasy or mythical beings and creatures, and pictures or sounds likely to be scary to young children."

I believe that with the direction I am heading all of these requirements can be easily not restricting the audience I can reach allowing for younger audiences to play too.
