* Video Games help maintaining a social life in young people during the pandemic
  * [(Bengtsson, Bom and Fynbo, 2021)](../evaluation/reference-list.md)
* Gaming sales had up to 75% growth in the US during the pandemic beginning and later on in the year around 30%&#x20;
  * [(Epstein, 2020)](../evaluation/reference-list.md)
* During the peak of covid in 2020, more than 214 million people played video games for over an hour a week. This was 64% of adults and 70% of people under 18
  * [(Fitzgerald, 2020)](../evaluation/reference-list.md)
* Throughout the pandemic, anxiety, depression, sleep disruptions, and thoughts of suicide have increased for many young adults according to [(Clement, 2021)](../evaluation/reference-list.md). So video games can act as "a sort of escape that has captivated in our fantasies with the world in the grip of the epidemic; or, it plays an unexpected role to provide comfort and social connection in a time of isolation and struggle."
