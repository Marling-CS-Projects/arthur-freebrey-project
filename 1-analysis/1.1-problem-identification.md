# 1.1 Problem Identification

In the past few years during the worldwide pandemic and the multiple COVID-19 lockdowns many people have found new ways to connect with others online and form new relationships. The Covid pandemic has however had many detrimental affects on many peoples mental well being throughout this time period  this can be shown by [(Clement, 2021)](../evaluation/reference-list.md) stating that throughout the pandemic, anxiety, depression and more issues surrounding an individuals mental health have increased for many young adults leading many people finding their own individual ways to cope with the issue. One of the ways many people used to help cope with the increasing mental strain throughout the pandemic was through playing video games. Video games can supposedly act as "a sort of escape that has captivated in our fantasies with the world in the grip of the epidemic; or, it plays an unexpected role to provide comfort and social connection in a time of isolation and struggle." [(Zhu, 2020)](../evaluation/reference-list.md). One of these ways gaming has helped however is its ability to reportedly help people maintain their social life and relationships [(Bengtsson, Bom and Fynbo, 2021)](../evaluation/reference-list.md).

This increase in the number of people expressing their interest in playing video gaming during the lockdown has lead to a massive increase in gaming sales as a whole. Gaming sales have been reported to had up to 75% growth in the US during the pandemic beginning of 2020 and later on in the year around 30% [(Epstein, 2020)](../evaluation/reference-list.md). This increase had over half of the American population playing some form of video games valuing the industry at $139 billion in the first year alone of the pandemic [(Farokhmanesh, 2021)](../evaluation/reference-list.md).&#x20;

The nature of video games however has allowed for many users to keep searching for new experiences and games since they receive gratification through the flow of completion in a video games with a manner that's different to real life consequently leading them to move between games without satisfaction [(Pang, 2019)](../evaluation/reference-list.md). Because of video games addictive nature in the peak of COVID in 2020, more than 214 million people played video games for over an hour a week [(Fitzgerald, 2020)](../evaluation/reference-list.md).

I am going to attempt to solve these problems of a need for a new video game by making a 2D RPG video game with a focus being on longevity allowing people to keep playing without the need to search for a new experience. The game will be able to download for free on any PC so people will be able to the game without having to worry about any costs in order to enjoy the game.&#x20;
