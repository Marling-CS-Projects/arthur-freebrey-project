## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is the process of removing irrelevant details from a problem to put more focus on the issues at hand by simplifying it to its main core components. This is very important in development since more time can be spent tackling the main issues instead of the extraneous parts.

I will use abstraction in my project to:

* Design simple graphics and art since I believe that more effort should be put into the gameplay and experience rather than making the graphics look realistic. Due to this lack of high resolution this would also make the game easier to develop and run by lowering the machine requirements.
