## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is the process of removing irrelevant details from a problem to put more focus on the issues at hand by simplifying it to its main core components. This is very important in development since more time can be spent tackling the main issues instead of the extraneous parts.

I will use abstraction in my project to:

* Design simple graphics and art since I believe that more effort should be put into the gameplay and experience rather than making the graphics look realistic. Due to this lack of high resolution this would also make the game easier to develop and run by lowering the machine requirements.
* Design a clear and sensible GUI menus that allow for easy navigation. The interfaces only need to be functional and easy to understand since this is not a key focus of the project and only distracts from the main content.

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead is the process of planning out the steps you will take and how to get there to achieve your end goal. This is essential to programming since it allows you to envision your process and where you next need to go.&#x20;
