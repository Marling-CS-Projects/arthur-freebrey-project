### Overview

Stardew valley is a top down RPG farming simulator created by Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone with its first release being in February 2016. In the game, the player takes the role of a villager in a small town where you have been given a small plot of land where you can farm and build. The game also involves high levels of exploration and unique interactions with NPC's being able to form and create relationships with them. The aim of the game is to keep restoring the farm you were given whilst earning money and making friends throughout.

### Controls

Stardew valley is available on over 10 different platforms with the most popular being the PC edition so I will mainly refer to their controls here. The arrow keys move the character as well as the WASD keys. This combined with scrolling to adjust the toolbar and clicking to interact with many items makes for quite a simple experience with not many specific key combinations needed to be learnt. Because of the simple controls and play styles this allows for an experience almost anyone can play and enjoy.&#x20;

The world design of stardew valley is a vast map with layers you can explore and unlock but very little in the form of a linear progression system that you have to follow.&#x20;
