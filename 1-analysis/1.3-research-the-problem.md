### Overview

Stardew valley is a top down RPG farming simulator created by Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone with its first release being in February 2016. In the game, the player takes the role of a villager in a small town where you have been given a small plot of land where you can farm and build. The game also involves high levels of exploration and unique interactions with NPC's being able to form and create relationships with them. The aim of the game is to keep restoring the farm you were given whilst earning money and making friends throughout.
