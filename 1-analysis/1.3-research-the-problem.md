### Overview

Stardew valley is a top down RPG farming simulator created by Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone with its first release being in February 2016 with a PEGI age rating of 12+. In the game, the player takes the role of a villager in a small town where you have been given a small plot of land where you can farm and build. The game also involves high levels of exploration and unique interactions with NPC's being able to form and create relationships with them. The aim of the game is to keep restoring the farm you were given whilst earning money and making friends throughout.

### Controls

Stardew valley is available on over 10 different platforms with the most popular being the PC edition so I will mainly refer to their controls here. The arrow keys move the character as well as the WASD keys. This combined with scrolling to adjust the toolbar and clicking to interact with many items makes for quite a simple experience with not many specific key combinations needed to be learnt. Because of the simple controls and play styles this allows for an experience almost anyone can play and enjoy.&#x20;

The world design of stardew valley is a vast map with layers you can explore and unlock but very little in the form of a linear progression system that you have to follow. Alongside this the game does not just provide the freedom of exploration but also customisation. The player is able to customise their house and map around them by building and destroying things in the environment. Because of this open world style of gameplay this allows for an enjoyable unique experience where no two people have the same game.

## Minecraft

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1) (1).png>)

### Overview

Minecraft is a 7+ rated 3D open world sandbox game where players can either play in a survival tactical mode where the player has to fight for survival and food or rather a creative mode where the player is free to explore and build whatever they would like with infinite resources. This game is primarily characterised by its characteristic of being able to destroy anything in the game as well as build whatever you would like with no restrictions. This game having infinite procedural generation never makes the experience for any two players the same. Alongside the building mechanic players also have to fight for food as well as fighting enemies such as zombies for survival.

### Controls

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png>)

Minecraft's main platform is the PC edition where the controls consist of a combination of the keyboard and mouse with the WASD keys mainly used to move and both mouse buttons to interact with different objects. Another key feature is accessing the users inventory which is done by pressing the E key which presents the user with a simple UI allowing them to interact by using the mouse buttons.

### Story and World Design

Minecraft has no specific story to its game but is instead an open experience wear the user can play the game however they desire. This leads to many unique creations from the game as a result of the freedom provided to the user throughout.\
\
The world design is another main feature of the game with the whole world being infinite and procedurally generated which allows for no two of the same map. Since the map changes per world and user with also infinite possibilities this sandbox game can have no specific way the game is to be played or enjoyed.&#x20;

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Procedural generation | This aspect of the game I don't believe is suited for the style I am going for and may prove to be too much of a challenge for me to develop in the time given. |
| 3D Graphics           | The graphics I have chosen will be more simplistic 2D pixel art since 3D graphics would be too complicated with the libraries I have chosen.                    |
| Boss battles          | I believe this creates tension for the game which is not the thing I am aiming for since I want a more relaxing experience playing                              |

## Undertale

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png>)

### Overview

Undertale is a top down 2D RPG video game created by Toby Fox in 2015 with a recommended age rating of 12+. The game involves a unique mechanic of players either being able to play as a pacifist without engaging in combat or fighting all or every NPC along with multiple 4th wall breaks.

### Controls

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)

With Undertale's main platform being the PC the controls consist of the arrow keys to move the main character around a 2D plane with the Z, X or C keys to interact with objects and dialogue. However during in game battles or fights the mechanics differ. This involves moving a small red heart inside a 2D box whilst dodging incoming objects or obstacles. These controls are very easy to pick up for almost any audience making the game suitable for large audiences.

### Story and World Design

Undertale involves the story of you, the player, rescuing a child who is stuck below the earth having to go through many obstacles in the forms of enemies and puzzles on the journey. As mentioned earlier the player can go through many different styles of playing of either attacking or pacifism. The decisions the player makes can leave to different outcomes of the story throughout multiple playthroughs.\
\
The world design is very simple in Undertale with one simple path the player can follow to progress in the game. This simple level design makes the story easy to follow and not get lost in.

The world design is another main feature of the game with the whole world being infinite and procedurally generated which allows for no two of the same map. Since the map changes per world and user with also infinite possibilities this sandbox game can have no specific way the game is to be played or enjoyed.&#x20;
