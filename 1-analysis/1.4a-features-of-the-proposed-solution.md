# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Controls

As I plan for my game to be primarily available on the PC I would like the controls to be simple to understand to allow for a large audience to be able to experience and enjoy the game. Because of this I believe using the keyboard and mouse is the easiest option and using the WASD format with mouse clicking to interact. The WASD keys would be used for movement in the character whilst the mouse can be used to interact with objects or NPC's throughout.

## GUI

I would like my game to have a simple GUI upon pausing and launching the game. I would like for this GUI to be simple and minimalistic making for a simple experience with some options of customisation and leaving or saving the game. The main goal in this menu is to initiate the game to the users liking but also making it easy to navigate for anyone whether they are just customising settings or loading into an existing game.

## Level Layout and Design

Maps will consist of a wide open space with multiple layers to explore including insides of buildings too. This will allow for for a unique playing experience with multiple areas to explore, collisions will be an important part of seeing where players can and can't reach.

### Top down view

The top down view in these video games allows for a wide view of the map around you and where you are going. These camera angles are easy to program and implement since the camera just needs to follow the player with a zoomed in camera hiding some aspects around the character.

### Puzzles

I would like the game to have mini puzzles to get through to certain areas but would not like them to be too difficult or important to the game. I believe the puzzles should be a small novelty that everyone should still be able to figure out for a small sense of challenge and reward.

### Enemies

Another feature I would like to implement is enemies to fight with simple combat mechanics. I would like these enemies to be cartoonish and not realistic to make them child friendly but keeping people engaged whilst not being too challenging.

## Limitations

### Multiple platform support

Due to the nature of my game I am going to make the game only available for PC meaning other platforms and controls will not be supported. This allows more development time to be allocated on functionality on one single device before expanding.

### Map Size

Due to time restraints I will not be able to make the map as large and detailed as I would like so in some parts only basic concepts will be developed.
