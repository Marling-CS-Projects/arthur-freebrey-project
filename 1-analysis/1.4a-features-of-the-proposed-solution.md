# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Controls

As I plan for my game to be primarily available on the PC I would like the controls to be simple to understand to allow for a large audience to be able to experience and enjoy the game. Because of this I believe using the keyboard and mouse is the easiest option and using the WASD format with mouse clicking to interact. The WASD keys would be used for movement in the character whilst the mouse can be used to interact with objects or NPC's throughout.

## GUI

I would like my game to have a simple GUI upon pausing and launching the game. I would like for this GUI to be simple and minimalistic making for a simple experience with some options of customisation and leaving or saving the game. The main goal in this menu is to initiate the game to the users liking but also making it easy to navigate for anyone.
